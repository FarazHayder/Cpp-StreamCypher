# Stream Cipher Program
Welcome to the Stream Cipher Program repository! This C++ program, named "StreamCypher.cpp," functions as a stream cipher, providing the ability to convert text into ciphertext and vice versa. Developed by Faraz Hayder, this program utilizes fundamental programming concepts to achieve its functionality.

## About the Program
The Stream Cipher Program offers the following features:
- **Text Encryption and Decryption**: Convert plaintext into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext using the stream cipher algorithm.
- **Fundamental Programming Concepts**: Utilizes fundamental programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and loops.
- **Straightforward Design**: The program is designed with simplicity and versatility in mind, making it easy to use and adapt.
- **Secure Communication**: Enables secure communication by encrypting and decrypting messages using the stream cipher technique.

## Getting Started
To use the Stream Cipher Program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the C++ program "StreamCypher.cpp" using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary file to start the program.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt text as needed.
4. Enjoy the secure communication provided by the stream cipher algorithm!

## Technologies Used
This Stream Cipher Program is implemented using C++ and utilizes fundamental programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and loops.

## Usage
To use the Stream Cipher Program, compile the C++ source code and execute the compiled binary file:
```bash
g++ StreamCypher.cpp -o StreamCypher
./StreamCypher
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt text using the stream cipher algorithm.
